# Project Title
## Overview
    Project Title is simple game about protecting a recently found treasure. The gameplay focuses on casting spells by drawing different shapes to knock out incoming bandits. The bandits will try to steal the treasure in the center of the map while the player tries to defend.

    Powerful spells can be cast by drawing shapes with the mouse. Triangles and circles and set traps on the ground or cause big explosions. 

    The game ends when a bandit successfully escapes with the treasure or the player defeats all the enemies in that round. If a bandit is defeated while carrying the treasure, it will drop and the map will re-orient itself with the treasure's new position as the center.


## Functionality
